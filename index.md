Hi I'm Dan. I'm interested in what makes humans special, the difference between AI & humans and how to bridge that gap. I've been strongly influenced by [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch), [Frank Tipler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Tipler), and [Bruce Nielsen](https://x.com/bnielson01) to name a few.  

In a previous life I co-founded SchoolFusion, an educational software company that connected millions of students, teachers & parents together in innovative ways. Since exiting I've worked on GPS social networks, a delayed messaging "art project", AR architecture, and one of the [first contact-tracing apps](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/coronavirus-social-smart-contact-tracing-app/).
