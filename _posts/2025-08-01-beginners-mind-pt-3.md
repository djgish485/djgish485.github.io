I dunno, it made the most sense in the moment. 4am, up and a lil annoyed at the national day fireworks, annoyed that I'm gonna have to deal w/ it again tonight. Then I just decided to do my best to soften + be compassionate. And explored what that really means. Cuz it's not necessarily something you can force + make happen. OTOH it is possible. And how does it fit together w/ [Beginner's Mind](https://dangish.net/2025/07/06/beginners-mind.html)? That's what's on my mind this AM. So of the biggest mofo questions. And it def feels *healing*.

Beginner's Mind, because compassionate mind comes before all the neurosis and improvement. But that's just like, an academic understanding bro. But not necessarily?? It def fits together w/ [advanced Beginner's Mind](https://dangish.net/2025/07/27/beginners-mind-pt-2.html), getting closer to neurosis & and frustration, exploring them; are they really a problem? When that's an apparent "no" it brings you back to simplicity, but a wise simplicity this time.

So ya, what I'm getting at here is Beginner's Mind Pt 3. Hah.

But it's true though â€” meditation -> simply bringing your attention back to the breath, brings you back to a primordial state of mind that's very shifting & dynamic, and the compassion, the softness allows you to touch into that dynamic, not bowl it over with what you thought that static state of mind was or bounce off back to the familiar neurosis. Comforting neurosis.
