And I wonder if inner turmoil is triggered a lot by the seasonality here? Like the quiet after the ski season is nice in many ways but defeats the one reason I'm here which is the rich concentration of friends. I mean it seems silly that such a thing could trigger something so deep & existential. As with a little bit of proactivity I could change it. But it's perhaps something deep & Jungian about the magic of having it all so effortless, effortless & **NATURAL**. It sparks something ancient or primordial in me. And again would that sense of magic be so strong if this thing was year-round here? It may be an unavoidable dynamic perhaps? Jungian you might say.

In any case, late April / May is the start of the year here. The great resetting. Autumn blends in nicely to ski season. And look at the support structure needed for places where the magic & seasonality is even greater â€” like [Grand Canyon guides](https://www.whalefoundation.org) eh.
