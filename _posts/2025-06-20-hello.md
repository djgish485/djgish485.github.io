> “If you don’t own your platform, someone else owns your voice.”

Two days ago Substack reassigned my dormant subdomain without a *single* confirmation click.  
That jolt nudged me to do what I’d been meaning to do anyway: move my writing to a place I **control**, in a format the future can read without breaking a sweat.

## Why GitHub Pages + Jekyll?

* **Plain Markdown → static HTML.**  
  No proprietary database, no JavaScript wall—just text files any crawler (or future LLM) can ingest.

* **Version history for free.**  
  Every edit is a Git commit; I can roll back, branch, or mirror anywhere in seconds.

* **Durability.**  
  Even if GitHub vanished, I’d still have a zip of my entire site that any web host could serve.

* **Zero cost, zero ads.**  
  The hosting bill = $0, and nobody slaps pop-ups on my prose.

## How this site is wired

1. **Repository:** `djgish485/djgish485.github.io`  
2. **Theme:** [`minima`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (tweaks coming soon)  
3. **Plugins:** `jekyll-feed` for RSS, `jekyll-seo-tag` for tidy metadata  
4. **Publishing loop:** *Write → Commit → GitHub Actions → Live in ~60 sec.*

## What to expect here

* Short essays on tech, tools, and the open web  
* Occasional dev notes when I break something interesting  
* Zero paywalls, trackers, or dark-pattern pop-ups—ever

If you were subscribed on the old platform, thank you for hopping over.  
Grab the **RSS feed** (`/feed.xml`) or just bookmark the home page—whichever suits your workflow.

See you in the next post!
