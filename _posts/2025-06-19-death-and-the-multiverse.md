There was nothing to do but face it. It was fucked. Life can be raw and fucked up, no way to sugarcoat it. Alexia was so very alive. She loved New York and being a party girl. I hope she felt a freedom flying those paragliders. I hope she at least had joy before that wrong turn. Cuz these sports can be pretty fucked. Can consider myself lucky to make it this far I spose. Maybe gained a sense for danger. But you never know.

In the multiverse, multiversal Dan could be dead many times over. And multiversal Alexia lives on in many parallel universes, of that I'm sure. I spose that's comforting in a way? How come many-worlders don't explore this topic more?
