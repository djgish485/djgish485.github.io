It sure seems like Peter Thiel is a fellow traveller. He's doing everything to echo de Chardin and Deutsch but actually labelling it. Him presenting techno-optimism or rather Omega Point-adjacent views as mainstream Christianity led to all kinds of confusion & clarification from the mainstream christian Douthat. He - Thiel - would've greatly benefited from explaining the basis of his views. He may not even know?

I have no idea about where his beliefs come from - did his college professor, the one with the scapegoat books, talk about Omega Point theology? Actually this is a strand worth pulling on - the view that technology and man's progress is a god thing I think predates and is bigger than de Chardin. Time to get theological. o3 would have some answers.
