Finding meaning in the meaningess. I guess that's what it's all about. Come into it with an innocent open [Beginner's Mind](https://dangish.net/2025/07/06/beginners-mind.html), face your neurosis by [feeling + investigating it](https://dangish.net/2025/07/27/beginners-mind-pt-2.html), seeing if it's a real problem. Add in a dash or a bucket of [compassion](https://dangish.net/2025/08/01/beginners-mind-pt-3.html), then let it all dissolve into pure openness, god willing.

It can seem endless, and maybe in some sense it is. It can seem meaningless, and maybe in some sense it is at the time. But the path itself creates meaning out of all of it. The fact that there is a path. I spose it's something that needs to be experienced.

The finale is about letting go. When you’ve honestly made friends with your neurosis this becomes possible. But you can’t hold on to it. When you’re practiced it has more of a fluttering quality - sympathetic controlling mind takes over, you catch it and come back to the parasympathetic mind. Sit with this in mediation and it can all settle down nicely. Maybe you can even catch a glimpse of how that pure openness is the background for it all, tying this whole thing together.

Good luck.
