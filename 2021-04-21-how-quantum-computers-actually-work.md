Mainstream explanations of quantum computers felt vague and confusing until I found **David Deutsch**, a key founder of the field.  
I wrote the post below with what I learned from Deutsch and was thrilled when he gave it a thumbs-up — I’m not totally crazy!

@djgish Looks right to me, but I'd have mentioned that most parallelisable computations aren't quantum parallelisable.<br><br>
(Also I wish people didn't call universal quantum computers 'quantum Turing machines'. That leaves no natural term for Turing machines implemented in quantum hardware.)
